### This repository serves as a guide for getting started with building and customizing on Avaya Experience Platform™.

Avaya Experience Platform™ is a contact-center-as-a-service solution that provides a suite of capabilities to orchestrate,
track, interact and report across voice and digital (email, chat and messaging) channels. It is built on an open, API-first
architecture leveraging REST based APIs for all capabilities to enable easy customization and integration into an Avaya
Experience Platform Customer’s back/front office ecosystem. 

Avaya Experience Platform™ makes it easy to connect everything—voice, video, chat, messaging, and more—to deliver effortless experiences for customers and employees at every touchpoint. And it brings together teams, resources, and insights to maximize contact center performance and experiences.

## Avaya Experience Platform™ APIs
Avaya Experience Platform™ offers public APIs enabling customers to extend the core functionality to build additional experiences. 

[Avaya Experience Platform™ APIs](https://developers.avayacloud.com/avaya-experience-platform) provide a powerful toolkit for contact centers to elevate their customer service to new heights. By leveraging automation, AI, and custom integrations, businesses can deliver effortless experiences, connect with customers across various channels, and optimize overall contact center performance. The result is improved customer satisfaction, increased operational efficiency, and a competitive advantage in today's ever-evolving business landscape.

Through Avaya Experience Platform™ APIs, businesses can automate various processes to streamline operations and improve efficiency. Automated call routing ensures customers are connected to the right agent quickly, reducing wait times and enhancing satisfaction. With AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, routine inquiries can be handled 24/7, freeing up agents to focus on more complex issues. Natural language processing and sentiment analysis capabilities also enable intelligent call handling, understanding customer emotions, and adapting responses accordingly.

Furthermore, businesses can create custom third-party integrations that align with their specific needs and workflows. By integrating customer data from CRM systems, businesses gain a comprehensive view of each customer's history and preferences, facilitating personalized interactions. Integrations with ticketing systems allow seamless issue resolution and follow-up, fostering stronger customer relationships.
